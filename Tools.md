This section includes a list of tools I have used in various challenges and some useful sources and documentation to utilize these tools.

## Radare2

`raise NotImplementedError`

## Ida

`raise NotImplementedError`

## Ghidra

On general, I use [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra), as I don't have a commercial version of Ida.
These are some of the important functionalities I use all the time:
- Patching: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>
- Showing references: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>
- Going: <kbd>G</kbd>
The [full purpose cheatsheet](https://ghidra-sre.org/CheatSheet.html).
For a dark mode, because I get migraines all the time, I used this [repo](https://github.com/zackelia/ghidra-dark).

## Windbg

I used Windbg for a 4n6 challenge, that in the end, didn't help at all. I learnt some cool functionalities though and I think it's a great tool, but quite complicated for a beginner like me.

I am listing some of the commands I used.

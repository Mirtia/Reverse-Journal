On general, I cannot say that I am an experienced CTF player. I have started playing Forensics since May of 2023 quite more seriously. I have tried exploring other categories such as Cryptography in the past,  but even though I am fond of Math, I can't say I was amused after diving a little deeper into it. I did continue solving more challenges since September in the [*Hack the Box*](https://app.hackthebox.com/home) platform where I started getting into more Reverse challenges overtime.

In my opinion, Reverse as a category is quite hard as it needs a solid low level background.
Fortunately, I did some work on that during my undergraduate studies but it was a bit dim when I was trying to fetch some knowledge from my main memory. I'm writing this journal to record my progress and also provide a summary of some background knowledge I thought it was useful.

It has been a rocky journey but it was quite rewarding and I hope from next year, I can easily solve harder Reverse challenges!
